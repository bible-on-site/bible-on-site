# General Practices

- **Prefer the latest stable version** of any toolset, framework, or package unless there is a specific compatibility concern.

## Language Policy

**No shell scripts (.sh, .bash) in this repository.**

- **DevOps**: Node.js/TypeScript (`devops/`)
- **Data processing**: Rust (`data/`)

## Tool Learning (Agents/Copilot)

1. Check `.github/tool-registry.md` for existing research.
2. If missing/outdated: use Context7 (`resolve-library-id` → `get-library-docs`), official docs, or GitHub.
3. Update the registry with tool name, version, date, and key learnings.
4. Apply learnings.

## Agent execution

**Do not ask the user to execute commands or steps.** Run commands, builds, and runs yourself (e.g. terminal, build, run app). If something is blocked (e.g. app already running), document what to do in comments or a short note; do not assign the user to "close the app and run again."

## Investigation

Use **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** for GitHub-related issues:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
gh run view <run-id> --json workflowName,event,conclusion
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits/<sha>
```
