# CI/CD Monitoring

When monitoring CI, checking PR status, or verifying a push:

- **Check ALL checks** — not just the "main" workflow. Use `gh run list` and `gh pr checks` to see every status check (GitHub Actions, Codecov, Codacy, CodeQL, dependency review, etc.).
- **A PR is green only when every check passes.** Codecov patch/project, Codacy diff coverage, and third-party checks all count.
- Report any failing or pending check with its name and failure reason.
- If a coverage check fails, investigate what code is untested and either add tests or adjust thresholds with justification.

```bash
# List all workflow runs for a branch
gh run list --branch <branch> --repo <owner>/<repo>

# List all status checks on a PR
gh pr checks <pr-number> --repo <owner>/<repo>
```
