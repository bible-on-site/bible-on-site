# Website (web/bible-on-site) Practices

## Development

- Use Playwright at http://localhost:3001 (`npm run dev` if needed).
- **Prefer server components for content**: content-rich (text, articles, sections) → SSG/SSR only for SEO and AIO. Use client components only for interactive/glue (navigation, animation, scroll, menu). Keep client components minimal and isolated; content should remain server-rendered.

## Commands

| Task | Command |
| ---- | ------- |
| Unit Tests | `npm run test:unit` |
| E2E Tests | `npm run test:e2e` |
| Unit Coverage | `npm run coverage:unit` |
| E2E Coverage | `npm run coverage:e2e` |

## Implementation Notes

- For test assertions: non-null assertion with a linter suppression comment explaining why it's safe.
- When catching errors, log with `console.warn` or `console.error`.
