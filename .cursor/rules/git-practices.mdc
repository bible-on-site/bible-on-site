# Git Practices

## Pre-commit

- Config: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`; venv: `devops/.venv/`; tool config: `devops/pyproject.toml`.
- Husky runs pre-commit via `.husky/pre-commit`.
- Adding a hook: add to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, then update `docs/devops/pre-commit.md`.

## Commit Process

1. **Before commit**: Review staged changes for PII (AWS IDs, API keys, passwords, emails). Use `git diff --cached`.
2. After `git commit`, pre-commit may auto-fix; check `git status`.
3. If files were auto-fixed, stage and amend:
   `git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r HEAD | xargs git add && git commit --amend --no-edit`
4. Push only when the working tree is clean.

**Agents**:
- **MANDATORY**: After every `git commit`, you MUST run `git status` and inspect the output. If the working tree is not clean (pre-commit hooks often auto-fix files), stage all changed files and amend: `git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r HEAD | xargs git add && git commit --amend --no-edit`. Repeat until the working tree is clean.
- When you make changes that should be committed, **you** commit and push—do not tell the user to run git commands.
- **NEVER** tell the user to run commands. You execute all commands yourself using the shell tool. This includes git commands, AWS CLI, docker, npm scripts, and any other CLI operations.

## Branch Management

Before pushing, check if the branch already exists on remote (may be merged/deleted):

```bash
git ls-remote --heads origin <branch-name>
```

If it exists: check if merged; if merged, use a new branch name; if not, fetch and rebase before pushing.

## Pre-Push: Merge from Master

**MANDATORY before every push**, the agent MUST:

1. Fetch and merge the latest `master` into the current branch:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin master
   git merge origin/master
   ```
2. If there are merge conflicts, **resolve them immediately** — inspect each conflicting file, apply the correct resolution (preserving both sides where appropriate), stage the resolved files, and complete the merge commit.
3. Only push after the merge is clean and the working tree has no conflicts or uncommitted changes.

## Post-Push: Monitor CI

**MANDATORY after every push**, the agent MUST:

1. Wait briefly (10–20 seconds), then check the CI status of the pushed commit/branch:
   ```bash
   gh run list --branch <branch-name> --limit 3
   ```
2. If a run is in progress, poll periodically (every 30–60 seconds) until it completes or the user intervenes.
3. If CI fails, inspect the failure (`gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`), diagnose the root cause, fix it locally, and push again (repeating the merge-from-master step).
4. Report the final CI status to the user.

## Pull Requests

- Use a new branch per feature/fix. PR is created when publishing the branch.
- Only @DoradSoft can merge unless explicitly delegated.
