# Git Practices

## Pre-commit

- Config: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`; venv: `devops/.venv/`; tool config: `devops/pyproject.toml`.
- Husky runs pre-commit via `.husky/pre-commit`.
- Adding a hook: add to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, then update `docs/devops/pre-commit.md`.

## Commit Process

1. **Before commit**: Review staged changes for PII (AWS IDs, API keys, passwords, emails). Use `git diff --cached`.
2. After `git commit`, pre-commit may auto-fix; check `git status`.
3. If files were auto-fixed, stage and amend:
   `git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r HEAD | xargs git add && git commit --amend --no-edit`
4. Push only when the working tree is clean.

**Agents**: After committing, always check `git status` and amend if pre-commit changed files.

## Branch Management

Before pushing, check if the branch already exists on remote (may be merged/deleted):

```bash
git ls-remote --heads origin <branch-name>
```

If it exists: check if merged; if merged, use a new branch name; if not, fetch and rebase before pushing.

## Pull Requests

- Use a new branch per feature/fix. PR is created when publishing the branch.
- Only @DoradSoft can merge unless explicitly delegated.
