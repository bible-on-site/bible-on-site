# AWS & GitHub Actions

## AWS

- Connect: `aws sso login --profile AdministratorAccess-<AccountID>`.
- All accepted changes must be reflected in IaC under `infrastructure/`.
- Do **not** run CloudFormation from `infrastructure/` templates; they are reference-only.
- When changing AWS process, update `docs/aws/`.

## GitHub Actions

Before editing `.github/workflows/`:

1. Re-enable VS Code extension `github.vscode-github-actions` if needed.
2. After changes, remove or disable the extension to avoid noise in the problems view.
