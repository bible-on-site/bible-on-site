# Agent Practices

**The agent performs tasks. The user does not.**

- Run commands yourself: build, copy scripts, installs, dev server, tests. Do not instruct the user to "run this in your terminal" or "then run the copy script."
- When working on flip book integration with the local `html-flip-book` repo: build in html-flip-book, then in the website run `USE_LOCAL_FLIP_BOOK=1 npm run postinstall` to copy the local build into node_modules (or add a script that runs that). Do not rely on the file: dependency in CI; the website uses the published npm package.
- Apply fixes, run linters, and verify; do not leave follow-up steps for the user unless they explicitly ask.
