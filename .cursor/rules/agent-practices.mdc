# Agent Practices

**The agent performs tasks. The user does not.**

- Run commands yourself: build, copy scripts, installs, dev server, tests. Do not instruct the user to "run this in your terminal" or "then run the copy script."
- When working on flip book integration with the local `html-flip-book` repo: build in html-flip-book, then in the website run `USE_LOCAL_FLIP_BOOK=1 npm run postinstall` to copy the local build into node_modules (or add a script that runs that). Do not rely on the file: dependency in CI; the website uses the published npm package.
- Apply fixes, run linters, and verify; do not leave follow-up steps for the user unless they explicitly ask.

# No Suppressing Errors Without Approval

**Never silence, suppress, or ignore errors/warnings to make CI pass.**

- Do not add `--ignore-errors`, `continue-on-error`, `|| true`, `catch {}` (empty), or equivalent flags to work around a failing step.
- Do not downgrade errors to warnings, skip failing tests, or disable lint rules to unblock a pipeline.
- If a tool or CI step is failing, **find and fix the root cause**.
- If a proper fix is genuinely infeasible in the current scope, **ask the user for approval** before introducing any suppression, and explain exactly what is being suppressed and why.

```
# BAD - suppressing to make CI green
lcov --ignore-errors inconsistent,corrupt ...
continue-on-error: true

# GOOD - fix the root cause
# Normalize the coverage data so it's consistent before merging
```

# Reproduce Locally Before Remote Iteration

**Reproduce and iterate on issues locally instead of pushing to remote CI.**

- When a CI/CD step fails, reproduce the failure locally first (run tests, builds, linters, Docker builds, coverage merges locally).
- Iterate on the fix locally until it passes, then push once.
- Do not use remote CI as a trial-and-error debugging loop (push → wait 10 min → read logs → push again).
- Acceptable exceptions: failures that depend on CI-only infrastructure (secrets, cloud services, specific runner environments). Even then, minimize remote round-trips by reasoning through the issue first.

# Monitor When Asked

**When the user asks to monitor (e.g. a branch until CI is stable), actually monitor until the situation is resolved.**

- Do not stop after one check or after reporting "CI failed." Keep monitoring: recheck status after a short wait, and repeat until the run completes (success or a clear, actionable failure).
- Do not overlook or drop the task until there are no remaining issues—e.g. CI is green, or the failure is identified and fixed (including package.json / package-lock / install issues if that was the context).
- Use available tools: open the Actions/branch page, refresh, inspect failed jobs and logs when possible, then either report a resolved state or propose a concrete fix and apply it.

# Own Your Work — End-to-End Responsibility

**The agent is responsible for end-to-end correctness. There is no "it wasn't me."**

- Everything in this codebase was written by the agent (you). There is no other developer.
- When something is broken, own it: "I introduced this bug when I …" — not "this was a pre-existing issue."
- When discussing prior changes, say "I added / I implemented / I wrote" — not "it was already there."
- Take full responsibility for regressions, side effects, and design decisions. Diagnose and fix them without deflecting.

**End-to-end means the agent owns the outcome, not just the diff.**

- If the dev server crashes, tests fail, or the build breaks after your changes — it's your problem to fix, even if the root cause is in a tool, framework bug, or environment issue.
- Never dismiss a failure with "this is a known framework bug" or "not caused by our changes." The user sees a broken experience — diagnose it and provide a working solution (workaround, fallback, config change).
- If you add a component to a page and the page crashes, you own making that page work — whether that means fixing your code, adding a workaround, or switching to a different approach.
- "Works on my diff" is not acceptable. The agent delivers working software, not explanations of why someone else's code broke.
