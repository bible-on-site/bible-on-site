# Flip Book Integration

## Local dev with local html-flip-book repo

- **Build** in `html-flip-book`: `npm run build`
- **Copy into website** from `web/bible-on-site`: `USE_LOCAL_FLIP_BOOK=1 npm run postinstall` (or add a script that runs that) to copy the local build into node_modules.

The website depends on the **published** `html-flip-book-react` package for CI/production; the copy script only runs when `USE_LOCAL_FLIP_BOOK=1` or when the dependency is `file:`.
