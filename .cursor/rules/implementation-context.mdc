# Implementation Context

## Project

Jewish Orthodox project. Avoid Christian terminology and reformist expressions. Perakim division is still used (not Parashot).

## Terminology

| Use This | Instead Of |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Tanah | Bible |
| Sefer (Pl: Sefarim) | Book |
| Perek (Pl: Perakim) | Chapter |
| Pasuk (Pl: Pesukim) | Verse |

Book “additionals” (e.g. שמואל א/ב): use Hebrew names in code; sub-splits are "Additional" in UI. See `docs/practices/implementation.md` for the full table.

## Code Quality

**Never ignore compiler or linter errors/warnings.** Fix all issues from TypeScript, Rust (Clippy), .NET, Biome, ESLint, and other static analysis. **Maintain 0 errors and 0 warnings** (0 problems in VS Code).

**After making fixes:** Always verify the build/linter. Run the relevant build or lint command for the changed area (e.g. `dotnet build` for app, `npm run build` or `npm run lint` for web) and fix any remaining errors or warnings before considering the change done.

**Known exceptions** (ignore only these): In `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, "Context access might be invalid: module_changed" and "Unable to find reusable workflow".
