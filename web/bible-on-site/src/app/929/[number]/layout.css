/* When the book (Sefer) view is active, remove the heavy SEO content
   from the rendering pipeline entirely.  The SEO markup (full perek text,
   commentaries carousel, articles carousel) stays in the static HTML for
   crawlers but is pulled out of layout/paint so it doesn't cause jank
   during flip animations.  The data-book-view attribute is toggled by
   SeferComposite.tsx.

   We use BOTH display:none AND content-visibility:hidden.
   - display:none removes the element from layout and paint.
   - content-visibility:hidden tells the browser to skip style
     recalculation for the entire subtree, which display:none alone
     does not always guarantee for deep DOM trees.  */
