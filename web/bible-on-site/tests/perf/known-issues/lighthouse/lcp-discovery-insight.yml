# Known Lighthouse audit issue
id: lcp-discovery-insight
strategy: desktop
explanation: |
  LCP request discovery insight reports 0% score intermittently in CI.
  The LCP element (likely an image or text block) may not be immediately
  discoverable in the initial HTML due to Next.js SSR/hydration timing.
  This audit is flaky in CI environments due to varying network conditions
  and server response times affecting when the LCP element becomes visible.
