# This workflow submits NuGet dependencies to GitHub's dependency graph.
# NOTE: This workflow does NOT replace GitHub's "Automatic Dependency Submission (NuGet)"
# dynamic workflow. The dynamic workflow is controlled by GitHub and cannot be modified
# through repository code. To fix the dynamic workflow failures, you must disable
# "Automatic dependency submission" in repository Settings > Security > Dependency graph.
# This custom workflow provides a working alternative that installs MAUI workloads.
