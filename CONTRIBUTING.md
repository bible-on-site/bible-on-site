# Contributing to Bible on Site
Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Bible on Site!

There are several ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Generalists
Please report any bugs found on a production platform (website, app, etc.).
This could be anything, from malfunctioning feature to a typo within an article.

## Technologists
There are many ways to contribute to the Visual Studio Code project: logging bugs, submitting pull requests, reporting issues, and creating suggestions.

After cloning and building the repo, check out the [issues list](https://github.com/bible-on-site/bible-on-site/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue). Issues labeled [`help wanted`](https://github.com/bible-on-site/bible-on-site/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) are good issues to submit a PR for. Issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/bible-on-site/bible-on-site/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are great candidates to pick up if you are in the code for the first time. If you are contributing significant changes please discuss with the assignee of the issue first before starting to work on the issue.
